C++ Notes

1.Introduction
C++ is Low level language means it works close with the OS, High level means not in depth
You can do meremory management using C++, or more control over memory
Most Popular language used for competitive programming
Semicolon is compulsary in C++

2.Program Structure
#include<iostream> // Header File
using namespace std; // namespace so we can avoid writing std::cout
int main() { // Start Point is main
    cout<< "Hello World";
    return 0; // Successful program termination
}

3.Variables
Variables are containers to store data.
There are primarity these datatypes we have
Int - 1,2,0,-1
Float - 1.21, 3.77
Char - 'a', 'b', 'z'
Double - Same like float, if you need to store more decimal numbers we use double 1.252342343
Boolean - true, false

Synax to declare a Variables
Datatype variableName = value;
int sum = 36;

Scope of Variables
1.Local - Written inside curly braces
2.Global - written outside func accessible from any func.
Can Local and Global Varibale have same name ? Yes
Wile accessing variable priority is given to local Varibale, to access global variable we use ::variableName (Scoperesolution operator ::)

Rules to declare a variableName in C++
- Variable Name can range from 1 to 255 characters
- Variable Name should begin with letter or underscore(_)
- After 1st letter, Varibale Name can also 
- Variable Name are Case Sensitive
- No Spaces or Special Characters are allowed
- Cannot use any C++ Keyword (reserved word) as a Variable name

4.Datatypes
Datatypes are chatagorized into 3 groups
BuiltIn - int, float, char, double, bool
UserDefined - Struct, Union, Enum
Derived - Arrays, Functions, Pointer

when we write 34.4 bydefault c++ take it as a double
if we mention 34.4f or 34.4F c++ take it as float and 34.4l or 34.4L as long Double

There are more datatypes like short int, long int, long double etc 
just size in byte changes and range changes. Eg shortInt is 2byte size while Int is 4 byte. 

5.iostream
Input Output Stream
for accessing cout and cin
What is Stream ?
Input Stream - Direction of flow of bytes take place from input device eg:keyboard to main memory.
Output Stream - Direction of flow of bytes take place from Main Memory to the Output devices eg:Display

cout<< - '<<' is called Insertion Operator
cin>> - '>>' is called as Extraction Operator

6.Header Files
There are 2 types of header Files
- System Header Files - It comes with the compiler eg:iostream
- User Defined Header Files - #include"this.h" // will give error is this.h is not present in repo

7.Operators in C++
- Arithmetic Operators - + - * / % a++ a-- ++a --a
- Comparision Operator =
- Logical Operator && || !
- Bitwise operators - TODO
